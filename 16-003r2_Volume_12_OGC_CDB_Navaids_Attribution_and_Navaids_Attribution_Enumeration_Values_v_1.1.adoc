= Scope

This informative CDB document provides a list and description of the instance-level attribution fields held in Navigation _Dataset Instance Attribute_ files. This content was originally in Annexes H and I, Volume 2 CDB Best Practice.

For ease of editing and review, the standard has been separated into 12 Volumes and a schema repository.

* Volume 0: OGC CDB Companion Primer for the CDB standard. (Best Practice)
* Volume 1: OGC CDB Core Standard: Model and Physical Data Store Structure.
